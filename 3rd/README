PassControl
a BTextControl _built_ for passwords.

The idea around this class is that you shouldnt need to modify your code too much to make a BTextControl in your app do passwords.
Here's whats different:
- Text() is not advisable unless you want a bunch of *'s. Use the actualText() function instead
- SetText() is safe. It will do The Right Thing â„¢ if you hand it a string (UTF8 too).
- everything else is called within the class.

Stuff you might need to change:
- Anything that looks bad. And if you want to mail me those changes, go right ahead and I will most likely include them in a future release.

Other stuff:
- Special thanks to David Sowsy for helping squash an early bug and speeding up the release.
- Really HUGE thanks to Scott Lindsay for adding multi-byte char support and dynamic "actual" buffer stuff.
- If you use this in your application, I would very much appreciate some recognition, even if your code is just based on my rats nest :) PassControl is free, but it didnt write itself :)

oh yeah: "Its your own damn fault if this code breaks your machine". It "shouldnt", but I take no responsibility in any way if it does. It didnt break the machines I've run it on, so I've deemed it "safe". Use at your own risk. Blah Blah Blah Blah.
